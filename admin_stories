1. Secure Portal Login

Title: As an Admin, I want to Log into the portal with my username and password, so that I can manage the platform securely and access administrative functions.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system successfully authenticates and redirects the Admin to the Admin Dashboard upon correct credential submission.

The system displays a clear error message if the username or password is incorrect.

The system implements brute-force protection (e.g., account lock-out) after a defined number of failed attempts.

**Priority: High
**Story Points: [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:
Password must be hashed using a strong, industry-standard algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

User interface must support accessibility standards.

2. Secure Portal Logout

Title: As an Admin, I want to Log out of the portal, so that I can protect system access and safely terminate my session.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user is immediately redirected to the Login page after clicking the "Log Out" button.

The user's server-side session is immediately invalidated.

Attempts to navigate back to protected pages (like the Dashboard) after logging out must redirect the user back to the Login page.

**Priority: High
**Story Points: [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:

A confirmation dialog should appear if the user attempts to log out while having unsaved changes on a form.

3. Adding New Doctors

Title: As an Admin, I want to add new doctors to the portal, so that they can be assigned patients and appointments.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Admin can successfully fill out and submit a form with required doctor details (Name, Specialization, Email, Initial Password/System Generated Password).

The system creates a new user profile with the Role: Doctor and an initial status of 'Active'.

The system validates that the provided Email address is unique before creation.

An email with initial login credentials is sent to the new doctor's email address.

**Priority: High
**Story Points: [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:

Doctor's specialization should be selected from a predefined, configurable list.

4. Deleting Doctor's Profile

Title: As an Admin, I want to delete a doctor's profile from the portal, so that I can manage current staff and remove personnel who have left.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Admin can search for a doctor and initiate the deletion process.

The system confirms the action with a warning, stating the impact on historical data.

The system performs a Soft Delete (setting the status to 'Inactive') to retain historical appointment data.

All future appointments associated with the deleted doctor are automatically cancelled or prompted for reassignment (with patient notification).

**Priority: Medium
**Story Points: [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:

A comprehensive audit log of the deletion/deactivation must be recorded.

5. Tracking Appointment Usage Statistics (DBA/System Admin View)

Title: As a DBA/System Admin, I want to run a stored procedure in MySQL CLI to get the number of appointments per month, so that I can track usage statistics and system growth.

Acceptance Criteria:

A stored procedure named GetAppointmentsPerMonth(Year) exists in the MySQL database.

When executed, the procedure returns a result set showing two columns: Month and TotalAppointments.

The procedure only counts appointments with status Completed or Scheduled (excluding Cancelled appointments).

The procedure executes successfully via the MySQL Command Line Interface (CLI).

**Priority: Medium
**Story Points: [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:

The stored procedure should be optimized to handle large volumes of data (performance consideration).

Output format should be easy to parse or export (e.g., CSV format).
